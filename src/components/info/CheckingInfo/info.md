## Filling up a Daily Check

Every end of the day, a daily check will be created. As the branch manager, you need to fill this up. To do so, click the **Input Daily Check** button. Upon doing so, the Daily Check modal shows up where you need to input the current balances of each of the items requested to be checked. Once done, click the **Submit** button.
