## Viewing Products

These are all the products that are in the database. You can filter the products based on their name, barcode, textcode, or description by using the product search bar, and/or by their category.

## Creating a Product

To create a product, click the **Create Product** button at the upper right. Then, proceed with filling up the Create Product form that will show.

The form has two parts:

1. The general settings of a product
2. The settings of a product that are specific only to the branch

Once done, click the **Create** button.

The Edit Product form will then show containing the current values of the product. Change any information you want to edit.

Similar to the Create Product functionality, the form has two parts:

1. The general settings of a product
2. The settings of a product that are specific only to the branch

Once done, click the **Edit** button.

## Removing a Product

To maintain the history of transactions/data associated to the product to be deleted, a product is only **soft deleted** from the database (i.e. a `hidden` value is just set to `true` instead of actually removing it from the database).

To remove a product, click the **trash** icon found at the right side of the product.
