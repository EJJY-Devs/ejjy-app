A branch cannot be created if it cannot be communicated via the value supplied in the Online URL. Therefore, a branch must first be setup and exposed to the online world via a "tunnel" (using localhost.run).

## Editing a Branch

To edit a branch, click the **pencil** icon found at the right side of that branch. The Edit Branch form will then show where the current values of the branch data are shown. Change the information you want to edit.

## Removing a Branch

To delete a branch, click the **trash** icon found at the right side of that branch. The Delete functionality will not really delete all the data in that branch's server but will only delete the branch entry in the online database and therefore, cutting the communication from the online web application to that branch.
