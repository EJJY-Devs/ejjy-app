## View Users

You can view all the users that are registered in the database here. There are different tabs found here which groups the users to where they currently belong. The following are the tabs and their descriptions:

- User List - users that don't belong to any branch. These are usually the office managers and the admins.

Each row displays the following details of the user:

- ID - This is the employee ID of the user which is a combination of the date when their account was created as well as a unique number from the database. The format is: <mmddyy>-<unique_number>
- Name - This is the full name of the user
- Type - This is the user's type. This can either be:
  - Branch Personnel
  - Branch Manager
  - Office Manager
  - Admin

## Edit a User

To edit a user, click the **Pencil** icon button. Upon doing so, the Edit User form will then show. There are two details of a user that you can edit:

- Branch - selecting the branch will assign/transfer that user to that branch. Since this user is transferred to that branch, its data will need to be added as a new entry in that branch's local database. Therefore, that new branch must be online. If it isn't (i.e. it can't be communicated by the online web application), an entry under the Pending User Transactions will be added below.
- User Type - you can only change the user type of a user if it's currently under **No Branch**. This, however, requires an approval from the admin to be finalized so after selecting the new user type, this user will be transferred to the **Pending Edit Users** tab

## Delete a User

To delete a user, click the **Trash** icon. Deleting a user will actually only hide all of its data from the system. However, it won't be completely removed from the database so that it can just be retrieved again.

If a user is currently assigned in a branch, that branch must be online because the online web application would need to communicate to it in order for the user's data in that branch's local database to be deleted as well. If it can't be communicated with, a pending user transaction will be created below.

You will then be redirected to the Assign User screen where you can select the days and the machine you want to assign that user to. To do so, click the **+** icon button of the day you want to assign. A dropdown of the machine where you will assign the user will then show. Select the correct machine.
