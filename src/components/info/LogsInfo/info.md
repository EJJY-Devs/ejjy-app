## Viewing the Logs

A log is basically any create, update, or delete action that any user from the system has performed. Each log contains the following details:

- Branch - some actions are performed to a target branch like adding a balance of that product in that branch. However, if the action performed is a general action (i.e. an action from the online app), then the branch is none/empty
- User - the user performing the action
- Description - a short description of the action
- Date & Time - when the action was performed

Furthermore, you can filter the logs by the target branch, by the user that performed the action, and/or by a date range of the date when the action was performed.
