In here, you can perform the following actions:

## Authorize the starting of the branch days

You can authorize the starting of the branch days in all of the cashiering machines in the branch and is equivalent to physical opening of the store. To do so, simply click the **Open Day** button.

Once the branch day starting has already been authorized, the display will update to the authorized state where you can see when the day of the whole branch has been officially started.

## Viewing the reports and connectivity statuses per machine

In the dashboard, you can view all the branch machines in your branch. For each of these machines, you can:

- View its connectivity status - the connectivity status is online if the back office machine can communicate with the branch machine and vice versa

- Generate a report of that machine
